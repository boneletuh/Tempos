======== 22/12/2023 ========
I have started making Tempos an os for fun and for learning purpuses.
I decided to make it in asm because i couldnt set up a cross compiler for C
but i think is a good idea cause i will learn assembly an low level programming better.
I dont plan to make a big os, just something that could be used

======== 28/12/2023 ========
I have make the os be able to print strings, im pretty proud and happy about it becuase i had never tried making anything like this.
now i will go to visit the family for new years eve

======== 03/01/2024 ========
Now its a new year, ill try to keep updating this os.
My target is along this year i will be working in the os and try to make something like a terminal

======== 08/01/2024 ========
The classes has started so ill be taking some time off this project
Maybe ill start using some language other than assembly
